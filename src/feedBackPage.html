            Dear Bincy miss; Thank you for being an amazing teacher and mentor.
            Your belief in me made a huge difference. I'll carry your lessons
            with me always. You've inspired me to love learning and see my
            potential. Thank you for creating a classroom where I felt seen and
            valued. Wishing you all the best!. Your dedication and passion come
            alive. Thank you for challenging me and for all the support. You've
            had a lasting impact.

            When we saw the message that you are leaving, it was honestly
            shocking. No one in this class ever expected this. I was happy
            thinking we might get a free period because you weren’t coming but
            that feeling didn’t last long.Thank you so much, Miss for supporting
            us in everything. We could always come and talk to you freely, and
            you cared for us just like your own children. I will miss you so
            much, and all the very best for your future🥹❤️. Please remember us
            sometimes don’t forget us while taking care of only the new
            students.😒

            Dear Bincy Miss, You are much more than a teacher to me, you are
            like a true friend, someone with whom I could share everything
            openly, just as I do with my friends. Knowing that you will no
            longer be in our college truly breaks my heart. It feels as though I
            have lost not only a wonderful teacher, but also a dear friend. Your
            presence, care, and guidance will always be deeply missed.
